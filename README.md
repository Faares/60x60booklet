# A Light Introduction to Advance Mathematics: an Abstract Algebra Approach.

> Still, a draft and I'm working on it.

This booklet written to be used in [60x60](https://salla.sa/durba/RYePmz) event, to provide the big picture of advance mathematics and how mathematician's really work. No deep technical nor tough subjects, It's written with intuition and simplicity in mind.
