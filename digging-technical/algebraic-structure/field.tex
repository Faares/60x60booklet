\section{Fields \label{fields}}

\subsection{Prologue}
The end of the last section was tricky, and it was intended for a purpose. Fields are very related to Rings, it developed over Rings, unlike the relation Rings and Groups. Every Field is a Ring with certain restriction conditions.

Mainly, Field developed to solve polynomials equations, side by side with Galois Theory, and other theories developed to solve equations with degrees 4,5, and more. But, I would rather -and prefer- to introduce it as a geometric concept instead of an algebraic. Why? I think its properties have geometric richness over algebraic. Even if we introduced the {\it extension} idea, it's clear that "Bigger" you have to pass through, needless to mention the relationship between the degree of the extension field and Vector Space.

Fields, as far as I can see, is the new form of the connected line between Numbers and Geometry, Discrete and Continues, a new and more abstracted form of $xy$-plane. Usually, we use $\mathbb{R}$ with simple $xy$-plane, now we use Field $\mathbb{F}$ with a set of vectors $V$ to define a Vector Space $\mathbb{V}= (V, \mathbb{F})$ -- The generalization of $xy$-plane.
