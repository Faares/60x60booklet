\subsection{Group \label{group}}
\subsubsection{Prologue}
Look at the integer set $\mathbb{Z}$, look into it again with the addition. Again, look and think about the behavior of $0$ with them. In school, we learned the natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ then the integers $\mathbb{Z}$, the Group structure is the evolution to the next step. It takes the properties of the system $(\mathbb{Z},+)$ to the next level. Abstract it, with elegancy.
