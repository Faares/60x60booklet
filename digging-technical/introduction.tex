\section{Understanding Mathematics}
Mathematician built a skyscraper over centuries, and in order to reach the wanted floor you have to pass through at least the requisite floors first. The learning process in mathematics is hierarchical, whenever you are well and good in the basics, you will get O-Ah! moment faster. In order to treat complicated things, we need to have tools process it accurately like surgical instrument in surgery. 

Over the history, Mathematics developed from vocabulary in Al-Khawarizmi era,  tell quantitize in Scientific Revolution era in 16-17th century, and finally symbolism in 18-19th century by Cantor, Whitehead, Russell and others - From them, we begin.

Before going towards, I assume the reader is already grasp the essential rule of Logic in Mathematics, since I will not explain it here because in my opinion Logic is intuitive and people don't need to learn it.
