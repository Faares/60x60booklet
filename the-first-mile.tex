\section{The First Mile in The Line of Mathematics}
Congratulation! You just completed the first mile in an infinite road -- which we mathematically express it by "Line".
All of what we introduced is just a light and very small step towards the world of mathematics. 
Each section in this booklet can be a single book, with a deep and wide view. We cut out many impressive topics, to keep this booklet small and simple as we can.

But! Always remember the general idea: Mathematicians Imagine, Think, and Play with their thought. Orchestrate a clever formal framework, Implement an intellectual strategy to attack problems precisely with accuracy.

I hope this booklet inspires a genius child, to be the next Euler, Gauss, or even Hilbert.
